# QuickNotes

**QuickNotes** is a full-stack note-taking application built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Django**.  
It provides a clean, responsive interface for managing notes, while Django serves as the backend API.

⚡ **Performance Note**  
This project is hosted on Render’s **free tier**, which has limited resources.  
Because of that, the app may feel **slow at times (first load, refresh, or heavy requests)**.  
The slowdown comes from hosting limits, not the application itself.
